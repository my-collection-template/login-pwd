# login-pwd-template
A login-pwd website with database (Additional Visual Studio template is adopted).

There are two templates available. One is [QuickApp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adentum.QuickApp-ASPNETCoreAngularXProjectTemplate). The other is [ASp.net core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/security/create-an-aspnet-mvc-5-web-app-with-email-confirmation-and-password-reset).

The latter one has lots of code folded into Package. Please refer to the [blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/aspnetcore-2-1-identity-ui/) and [More details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/scaffold-identity?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=visual-studio).

- May need to run this command in advance
  > dotnet tool install --global dotnet-aspnet-codegenerator
